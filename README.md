This repository is dedicated to my **hands-on learning and practice** with [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) â€” a powerful Python library for creating static, animated, and interactive data visualizations.  

Iâ€™ll be using this repo to **experiment, learn, and document** different ways of visualizing data using Matplotlib.

## ðŸŽ¯ Why I Created This Repo
- To build a **solid foundation in data visualization** with Python.  
- To collect **all my practice scripts in one place** for future reference.  
- To explore different chart types, customizations, and tricks with Matplotlib.  
- To eventually use this knowledge in **data science, analytics, and ML projects**.
